### Here are my questions,plwase read them
I use The most simple contract to test.<br>
there's my code:<br>
i run deploy/hello_deploy_wanchain.js to deploy,and then get the contract address *0xfdc82b90885BA8FD73b3643d4935527e46Cd5574*,because this contract address can't use, i must convert it to lowercase *0xfdc82b90885ba8fd73b3643d4935527e46cd5574*<br>
then,i call *balance* .The expectation is 100,But the return is empty<br>
Please help me figure out why ? Thanks
